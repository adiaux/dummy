# Dummy Repo :tada:
This is basically a repo I used to store my files for the Django based web-app I am working on. 

## All about the main project :confetti_ball:
The main Django based web-app is called taket, and this repository is a learning repository that would help me reach there. The Django web-app is not fully completed, however if you want it can always be accessed by checking this [repository](https://github.com/adiaux/taket)

## Who is this repo for ? :gem:
This repo is mostly for me. I, like many of you, host my code on GitHub for reasons of portability, ease of work, and peace of mind. Beyond my own needs, I have also open-sourced this repo for you, the reader (and most likely developer), to explore the things that make my site tick.
