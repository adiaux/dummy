Krusader-2.0.0 "Mars Pathfinder"
================================
The Krew is proud to present the first stable KDE4 release of your favourite
file manager! The development process was all about porting, all dependencies to
the Qt3 support libs have been removed. This is the first stable that comes with
experimental support for the Windows platform. Who thought that day will ever
come?

Even though this release contains quite a bunch of new features our main focus
was to create a KDE4 version that is ready for everyday use. Overall the release
is very usable but might contain bugs that haven't been present in prior
versions. Please provide us bug reports, feedback and patches to make it as
solid as the KDE3 version. Many thanks to everyone who supported us in the
porting process!

The highlights of this release are:

- Archive dialog now remembers Compression level
- View properties for detailed/brief/interviews are merged into one
- Bugfixes
- I18n updates

Changes since 2.0.0-beta2 (but not limited to):

  Or the direct shortcuts: copy by queue (SHIFT+F5), move by queue (SHIFT+F6)
