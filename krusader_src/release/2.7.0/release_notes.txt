----- 2.7.0 Peace of Mind -----

New feature: Quick Search in Bookmark menu
    - Just type letters to search: bookmarks are matched by name prefix
    - Once a single bookmark is matched, it's immediately triggered
    - If multiple bookmarks are matched by the prefix, they are highlighted
        and the first one is selected - hit Enter to activate the bookmark
    - Accelerators work only if the keystroke is the first one
    - Backspace is supported
    - Search is case insensitive unless you type a capital letter
    - Search bar visibility can be controlled in Konfigurator
    - Search bar is intentionally a read-only field

New feature: Tab pinning.
    - A pinned tab is a locked tab with temporarily changeable address.
    - Available from popup menu of a tab.

New feature: Tooltip with file information when you hover a file name.

New feature: Extended options for Tree Panel (activated by a popup menu at the header)
    - Show/Hide hidden folders
    - Start the tree from the closest Place (i.e. device)
    - Start the tree from current directory

New feature: -d option.
    - Turns on debug output in Krusader.
    - Helpful for bug reports - we encourage to attach debug console output to reports.

Change: Default Multi Rename shortcut is changed (Shift+F9 -> Shift+F2)
    to align with the default Rename shortcut (F2).

Addressed issues of using custom icon themes and running in non-KDE environments.
    - Icons are rendered according to per-icon fallback logic:
        - Your active theme is matched first
        - Fallback icon theme specified in Konfigurator is matched next
        - Breeze or Oxygen are matched next if they are installed.
            Please note that Breeze is icon-complete theme for Krusader,
            Oxygen has also become icon-complete recently, and these themes
            are considered to be weak dependencies of Krusader meaning that
            in order to run smoothly one of these should be installed
            (we don't require it's activated though).
        - If no match is found, a special "missing" icon is rendered.
    - Due to improved algorithms, your MIME icons (file type icons) should
        look better (more icons are found, they are coming from an active theme
        if found in there).

Fixed 40+ issues including some regressions. See ChangeLog.
