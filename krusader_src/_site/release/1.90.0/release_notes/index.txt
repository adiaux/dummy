Krusader 1.90.0 "Power Stone"
=================================
Well, here we are!

The Krew is finally bringing you the _last_ release of Krusader the
file manager for the KDE 3.x series. In this release you can expect 
many new Krusader Extensions sent in by our users + bugfixes.
We would like to thank all of the community for keeping us sharp all these
years throughout our release cycles. 

IMPORTANT: Crashes in Krusader caused by Qt 3.3.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've been getting a lot of emails and bug reports regarding random
crashes in Krusader, especially during some file operations (copy/move
etc.). These crashes are related to Qt 3.3.5 and NOT Krusader.
It seems that Qt 3.3.5 introduced a serious bug which is now causing
random crashes in many KDE applications including Konqueror. You can
google for it to find out more. 

As far as we know, Debian and SUSE already posted new Qt binaries that
fix the problem, and Gentoo has masked Qt 3.3.5 completely.
As for now, you either need Qt 3.3.4 or a fixed Qt 3.3.5, depending on
your distribution. For more information is available on our website at
http://krusader.sourceforge.net/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=1407
