## Bug FAQ

Frequently asked questions about thinks not working in Krusader and their solutions.

#### I cannot use my favourite protocol X (SFTP, MTP, NFS, SMB, ...) in Krusader ("Protocol not supported"). Why?

Support for these protocols is not inbuilt in Krusader but provided by [KIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIO). You need to addtionally install the corresponding protocol library. The package is most likely called **kio-extras**.

#### Some or many icons are missing in Krusader

Krusader uses icons which are contained in KDE Plasma's default icon set Breeze or other icon sets like Oxygen, make sure you have at least one of them installed. Other icon sets will most likely not contain all icons needed.
