<p>I am pleased to announce that <a
href="http://download.kde.org/stable/kphotoalbum/4.4/src/kphotoalbum-4.4.tar.bz2">KPhotoAlbum
4.4</a> is available for download.

<p>
The main improvements on this version are support for libkipi 2.0.0 and
greatly improved save time for the image database. Now it is also
possible to remove duplicate images while merging the tags to the
remaining image. And naturally a couple of bugs got fixed as well.
