<p>With the EXIF support in KPhotoAlbum, it is time to start the series of
              snapshots, you find the newest from the side bar, choose
              <tt>Download-&gt;snapshots</tt>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Marco Molteni for helping me get my scripts ready for
              producing snapshots</p>
