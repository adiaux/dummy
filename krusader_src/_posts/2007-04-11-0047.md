<p>PhotoAlbum 3.0.1 has been released, with huge thanks to Tuomas for
pulling this of, the changes are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Don't anymore ignore the selection in the first press of the Plugins
menu item, when plugin loading is delayed.</li>

<li> In member group tab of the configuration dialog, when changing
category from the dropdown list, items from a different category were
sometimes added to members listbox. Not anymore.</li>

<li> Selecting thumbnails with a mouse made more logical and fixed a bug
that sometimes prevented a selected thumbnail to be added into internal
selection list.</li>

<li> Raw files were rotated twice sometimes. Fixed by Michael J Gruber.</li>

<li> Cycles in member group configuration are not possible anymore.</li>
</ul>
